# 💳 Credit Card Users Churn Prediction

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project addresses the problem of **customer attrition** for **Thera Bank's credit card division**. With increasing competition in the financial sector, Thera Bank needed a predictive system to identify customers at risk of leaving and reduce churn through strategic interventions.

As a Data Scientist, I conducted detailed **exploratory data analysis**, built **machine learning models**, and derived **business insights** to support retention strategies.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The dataset is **confidential** and cannot be shared publicly due to privacy agreements.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Identify patterns in customer behavior associated with churn  
- Build accurate classification models to predict churners  
- Understand key features influencing a customer’s decision to leave  
- Recommend data-driven strategies to reduce churn

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques

- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, Scikit-learn, XGBoost  
- **Techniques:**  
  - Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  - Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
  - Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV)  
  - Evaluation Metrics (ROC-AUC, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix)

## 📂 Dataset Overview

While the dataset is private, it includes anonymized features such as:

- **Customer Demographics:** Age, Gender, Education Level, Marital Status, Income  
- **Account Metrics:** Credit Limit, Card Category, Tenure  
- **Behavioral Attributes:** Transaction Amount & Count, Credit Utilization, Contact Frequency  
- **Target Variable:** `Attrition_Flag` — indicates whether a customer churned

## 🔍 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and outliers  
- Encoded categorical variables  
- Scaled numerical features

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed churn distribution across demographics and behaviors  
- Visualized key relationships between features and churn

### 3️⃣ Model Building & Evaluation
- Baseline: Logistic Regression  
- Advanced: Random Forest, XGBoost  
- Metrics: Accuracy, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix

### 4️⃣ Hyperparameter Tuning
- Used GridSearchCV to optimize performance of Random Forest & XGBoost

### 5️⃣ Final Model
- **XGBoost** selected for its high ROC-AUC and generalization on test data

## 📈 Results & Insights

- 📉 Customers with **low contact frequency** were significantly more likely to churn  
- 💳 Users with **high credit utilization** (close to maxing out their credit limit) had higher churn probability  
- ⏳ Customers with **short tenure** (newer users) had higher churn risk  
- 👥 Married and middle-aged customers had lower churn rates

---

## 📚 What I Learned

- Applied **classification modeling** to a real-world customer retention problem  
- Improved skills in **feature engineering**, particularly with financial behavioral data  
- Understood the importance of **imbalanced class handling** and using the right metrics like ROC-AUC  
- Gained practical experience in tuning models using **GridSearchCV**  
- Strengthened storytelling through **visual analysis and stakeholder-ready dashboards**
